# QEPro

This repository contains operating code to interface with our lab's QEPro spectrometer as well as controlling polarization states with Thorlabs KDC101 motor controller. Hardware is obviously not included, and any necessary DLLs etc. can be found at each product's software download page.

Check the (GitHub repo)[https://github.com/junehoy98/QEPro] for the most recent version of this code.
